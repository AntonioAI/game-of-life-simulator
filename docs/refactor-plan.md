## Incremental Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure and Basic Module Setup ✅
1. **Create Directory Structure** ✅
   - Create the folder structure as outlined above
   - Move existing files to appropriate temporary locations
   - Test: Application should still work with the original files

2. **Setup Module System** ✅
   - Update index.html to use type="module" for script tags
   - Create empty skeleton files for each module with basic export statements
   - Test: Page should load without errors

### Phase 2: Extract Pattern Library ✅
1. **Refactor Pattern Library** ✅
   - Move pattern definitions to PatternLibrary.js
   - Create proper import/export for pattern functions
   - Test: Patterns should still load and can be applied to grid

### Phase 3: Grid Module Implementation ✅
1. **Extract Grid Logic** ✅
   - Create Grid.js with grid creation and manipulation functions
   - Move initializeGrid, toggleCell, and related functions
   - Properly export these functions
   - Test: Grid operations should work (creating, resetting grid)

2. **Update References** ✅
   - Modify main script to import from Grid.js
   - Replace direct grid manipulations with Grid module methods
   - Test: Grid initialization and cell toggling should work

### Phase 4: Rules Implementation ✅
1. **Extract Rules Logic** ✅
   - Create Rules.js with game logic (neighbor counting, applying rules)
   - Move countAliveNeighbors and nextGeneration calculation
   - Test: Simulation should progress correctly with rules

### Phase 5: Renderer Implementation ✅
1. **Extract Rendering Logic** ✅
   - Create Renderer.js for all canvas operations
   - Move drawGrid and related visualization functions
   - Test: Grid should render properly

2. **Connect Renderer with Grid** ✅
   - Update rendering to use Grid module's data
   - Test: Changes to the grid should be properly visualized

### Phase 6: UI Controls Extraction ✅
1. **Extract Control UI** ✅
   - Create Controls.js for UI element creation
   - Move functions that create control panels
   - Test: Control UI should appear and be properly styled

2. **Connect Controls to Actions** ✅
   - Ensure control interactions still work with the modularized code
   - Test: All buttons and controls should function

### Phase 7: UIManager Implementation ✅
1. **Create UIManager** ✅
   - Implement UIManager.js to coordinate all UI operations
   - Move UI initialization and setup code
   - Test: All UI elements should initialize properly

### Phase 8: GameManager Implementation ✅
1. **Create Basic GameManager** ✅
   - Implement GameManager.js with core game loop and state
   - Move simulation loop, state tracking, and game flow control
   - Test: Game loop should function properly

2. **Connect Components to GameManager** ✅
   - Update all modules to interact with GameManager instead of globals
   - Test: All game functions should work through GameManager

### Phase 9: Main Entry Point ✅
1. **Create Main Module** ✅
   - Implement main.js as the application entry point
   - Initialize GameManager and connect all components
   - Test: Complete application should work from main entry point

2. **Remove Global References** ✅
   - Replace remaining global variables with proper module imports
   - Test: Application should function without relying on window object

### Phase 10: Dependency Injection ✅
1. **Implement Dependency Injection** ✅
   - Refactor components to receive dependencies through constructor parameters
   - Update GameManager to inject dependencies to other components
   - Convert Rules class from static methods to instance methods
   - Add validation to ensure required dependencies are available
   - Test: All components now work with injected dependencies

### Phase 11: Clean Up and Optimization ✅
1. **Fix UI Issues** ✅
   - Resolve Pattern Library layout and styling issues
   - Ensure consistent UI behavior across components
   - Test: UI should work properly with no visual glitches

2. **Remove Legacy Code** ✅
   - Remove redundant code and unnecessary comments
   - Remove duplicate code in Renderer.js and PatternLibrary.js
   - Delete legacy files (script.js and root-level PatternLibrary.js)
   - Test: Application should still function correctly

3. **Performance Optimization** ✅
   - Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks
   - Improve Grid.computeNextGeneration with pre-allocation and local references
   - Optimize Renderer.drawGrid to eliminate redundant code and improve drawing performance
   - Add special handling for large grids in GameManager.simulationLoop
   - Test: Application should run smoothly with improved performance

### Phase 12: UI Enhancements and Polish ✅
1. **Improve UI Layout and Responsiveness** ✅
   - ✅ Refactor Grid Dimensions panel for better usability
   - ✅ Fix alignment issues in control panels
   - ✅ Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Test: UI should be more intuitive and visually consistent

2. **Visual Styling Improvements** ✅
   - ✅ Apply consistent styling across all UI components
   - ✅ Improve button states and interactive elements
   - ✅ Fix Pattern Library search functionality
   - Test: Application should have a polished, professional appearance

## Testing Between Phases
After each step within each phase:
1. Run the application in browser
2. Verify core functionality works:
   - Grid initialization
   - Pattern placement
   - Start/stop/step controls
   - Cell toggling via clicks
   - Generation counting and analytics
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Address any issues before proceeding to the next step

By following this incremental approach, you'll maintain a working application throughout the refactoring process while gradually improving the code structure.
