## Incremental Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure and File Organization
1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create the folder structure as outlined above
   - Create empty skeleton CSS files for each module
   - Test: Application should still work with the original CSS file

2. **Setup Import System**
   - Create main.css with @import statements for all modules
   - Add link to main.css in index.html
   - Test: Page should load with styles intact

### Phase 2: Extract Core Styles
1. **Extract Variables**
   - Move all CSS custom properties from :root to variables.css
   - Include color palette, spacing, shadows, and border radius
   - Update main.css to import variables.css
   - Test: Styles should remain consistent

2. **Create Reset and Base Styles**
   - Move reset styles (* selector, html, body) to reset.css
   - Include basic global defaults
   - Update main.css to import reset.css
   - Test: Page layout should be unaffected

3. **Extract Typography**
   - Move font-related styles to typography.css
   - Include text colors, sizes, weights, and line heights
   - Update main.css to import typography.css
   - Test: Text styling should appear the same

### Phase 3: Component Extraction
1. **Extract Canvas Styles**
   - Move #game-canvas and .canvas-container styles to canvas.css
   - Apply BEM methodology for class naming (e.g., .game-canvas, .game-canvas--active)
   - Update HTML with new class names
   - Test: Canvas should display correctly

2. **Extract Controls Styles**
   - Move .controls, .control-buttons, and related styles to controls.css
   - Apply BEM methodology for class naming
   - Update HTML with new class names
   - Test: Controls should function and appear correctly

3. **Extract Analytics Styles**
   - Move .analytics and related styles to analytics.css
   - Apply BEM methodology for class naming
   - Update HTML with new class names
   - Test: Analytics panel should display correctly

4. **Extract Pattern Library Styles**
   - Move .patterns, .pattern-gallery and related styles to patterns.css
   - Apply BEM methodology for class naming
   - Update HTML with new class names
   - Test: Pattern library should function and appear correctly

### Phase 4: Layout and Responsive Design
1. **Extract Layout Styles**
   - Move main, container, and structural layout styles to grid.css
   - Apply BEM methodology for layout class naming
   - Update HTML with new class names
   - Test: Page layout should remain consistent

2. **Extract Media Queries**
   - Move all @media queries to responsive.css
   - Organize by component or screen size as appropriate
   - Test: Responsive behavior should work across different screen sizes

### Phase 5: Utility and Animation Styles
1. **Extract Animation Styles**
   - Move keyframes and animation properties to animations.css
   - Test: All animations should continue to work

2. **Create Utility Classes**
   - Move helper classes to helpers.css
   - Consider adding additional utility classes for common patterns
   - Test: All utility classes should work as expected

### Phase 6: BEM Methodology Implementation
1. **Standardize Block Names**
   - Ensure all component blocks follow a consistent naming convention
   - Document block names and purposes
   - Test: Styling should be maintained

2. **Implement Element Naming**
   - Convert element selectors to BEM notation (block__element)
   - Update HTML to match new class names
   - Test incrementally by component

3. **Implement Modifier Naming**
   - Convert state and variant classes to BEM modifiers (block--modifier, block__element--modifier)
   - Update HTML and JavaScript references
   - Test: All state changes and variations should work

### Phase 7: Optimization and Cleanup
1. **Reduce Specificity Issues**
   - Identify and fix overly specific selectors
   - Ensure consistent specificity levels
   - Test: Styles should apply correctly

2. **Remove Redundancies**
   - Identify and consolidate duplicate properties
   - Create reusable utility classes for common patterns
   - Test: Visual appearance should remain unchanged

3. **Optimize CSS**
   - Check for unused styles and remove them
   - Ensure proper use of shorthand properties
   - Test: Application should render correctly with cleaner CSS

### Phase 8: Documentation
1. **Document CSS Architecture**
   - Create README file explaining the CSS organization
   - Document the BEM convention used in the project
   - Add code comments for complex selectors or calculations

2. **Create Style Guide**
   - Document available utility classes
   - List color palette and variables
   - Provide examples of component variants

- ‚è≥ In Progress
- üî≤ Not Started

## Testing Between Phases
After each step within each phase:
1. View the application in browser at different screen sizes
2. Verify all components render correctly:
   - Canvas and grid
   - Controls and buttons
   - Analytics panel
   - Pattern library
   - Animations and interactions
3. Check for visual regressions or styling issues
4. Test responsive behavior on different devices/screen sizes
5. Address any issues before proceeding to the next step

## Implementation Strategy
- Work on one component at a time
- Use temporary classes during transition to maintain functionality
- Keep original styles.css as a backup until refactoring is complete
- Commit changes after each component is successfully migrated

By following this incremental approach, you'll maintain a functional and visually consistent application throughout the CSS refactoring process while improving organization and maintainability.
