  - Spaceships (Glider, Lightweight Spaceship)
  - Growth patterns (R-Pentomino, Gosper Glider Gun)
- **Grid Settings**:
  - Adjustable grid size (preset: 50×50, 75×75, 100×100)
  - Custom grid dimensions support
  - Toroidal or finite boundary options
- **Real-time Analytics**:
  - Generation counter
  - Live cell count
  - Population density
  - Current grid size
  - Simulation speed
  - Boundary type
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Works on desktop and mobile devices
  - Touch-friendly interface
  - High-DPI display support

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntonioAI/game-of-life-simulator.git
   cd game-of-life-simulator
   ```

2. Run a local web server to serve the files:

   Since this application uses ES modules (`import`/`export`), you'll need to serve the files through a web server.

   **Option 1: Using Python:**
   ```bash
   # For Python 3.x
   python -m http.server

   # For Python 2.x
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

   **Option 2: Using Node.js:**
   ```bash
   # Install a simple HTTP server globally
   npm install -g http-server

   # Run the server
   http-server
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

   **Option 3: Using Visual Studio Code:**
   Install the "Live Server" extension, then right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

The grid will be pre-populated with the R-Pentomino pattern, ready to demonstrate Conway's Game of Life evolution.

## Usage

1. **Grid Interaction**:
   - Click/tap any cell to toggle it between alive (filled) and dead (empty)
   - Use the Pattern Library to place pre-defined patterns

2. **Controls**:
   - ▶ (Play): Start the simulation
   - ⏸ (Pause): Pause the simulation
   - ➡ (Step): Advance one generation
   - ↺ (Reset): Clear the grid
   - Speed slider: Adjust simulation speed from 1 to 60 FPS

3. **Grid Settings**:
   - Choose from preset grid sizes
   - Enter custom dimensions (10-200 cells per side)
   - Toggle between toroidal (wrapping) and finite boundaries

4. **Pattern Library**:
   - Use the search bar to find specific patterns
   - Click on a pattern thumbnail to place it on the grid
   - Patterns are categorized by type

## Technical Architecture

### Core Principles

- **Modular Architecture**: Components are decoupled and follow the single responsibility principle
- **Dependency Injection**: Core systems use a DI container to manage dependencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses requestAnimationFrame and efficient canvas operations
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Technical Highlights

- **No External Dependencies**: Built with vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules)
- **Responsive Canvas**: Automatically adjusts to viewport size
- **Device Optimization**: Special handling for mobile and touch devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in tools to measure render performance

### CSS Architecture

- **BEM Methodology**: Block, Element, Modifier naming convention
- **CSS Variables**: Consistent colors, spacing, and styling
- **Mobile-First Design**: Ensures proper display on all devices
- **Modular Structure**: Separated by concerns (core, components, layout, utilities)
