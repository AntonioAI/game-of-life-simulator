# DependencyContainer Migration Summary

## Overview

This migration replaces the deprecated `ComponentRegistry` with the modern `DependencyContainer` system. The ComponentRegistry was previously being used as a compatibility layer that forwarded all calls to DependencyContainer, but has now been completely decommissioned.

## Changes Made

1. Removed the legacy `ComponentRegistry.js` file (src/utils/ComponentRegistry.js)
2. Removed tests related to ComponentRegistry:
   - `src/tests/testComponentRegistry.js`
   - `src/tests/verifyDependencyContainerMigration.js`
3. Updated `src/tests/runTests.js` to remove ComponentRegistry test references

## Impact 

The `DependencyContainer` is now the sole dependency management system in the codebase. This improves:

- **Code clarity**: No confusing compatibility layer
- **Performance**: Removes unnecessary forwarding calls
- **Reduced code size**: Removal of old files and unnecessary code
- **Simplified development**: Single pattern for dependency management

## How to Use DependencyContainer

The DependencyContainer is initialized in `main.js` as a global container:

```javascript
window.appContainer = new DependencyContainer();
```

### Registering Components

```javascript
dependencyContainer.register(
  'componentName',    // The name to register the component as
  ComponentClass,     // The component class/constructor or object
  true,               // Whether this is a singleton (optional, default: false)
  ['dependency1', 'dependency2'] // Dependencies required by this component (optional)
);
```

### Resolving Components

```javascript
const component = dependencyContainer.resolve('componentName');
```

### Direct Singleton Access

```javascript
const singleton = dependencyContainer.getSingleton('componentName');
```

### Cleanup

```javascript
dependencyContainer.cleanupAll();
```

## Migration Complete

The migration is now complete, and all components should use DependencyContainer directly instead of the previously deprecated ComponentRegistry.
